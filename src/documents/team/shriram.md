Shriram Sundararaman is a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania currently pursuing a BSE in Bioengineering and a minor in Computer Science. He is originally from Northern Virginia and is excited by the applications of biotechnology and is aware that they are increasingly dependent on the field of computer science. He hopes through organizations like Pilot he can share his enthusiasm for practical thinking and learning. He claims to be pretty funny, but we'll just have to take his word for it.
