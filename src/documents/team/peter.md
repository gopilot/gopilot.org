Peter started learning CS when he started an iPhone app studio 13. He moved on from there to high school at TJHSST in Northern Virginia, and gained experience in web design, PHP, Node, Python, and Linux, by teaching himself and through summer internships. In his free time, he enjoys golfing, skiing, and working on his future startup ideas. He's also passionate about entrepreneurship and teaching others, so he's excited to be working on PilotDC, and is always looking forward to the next hackathon!
